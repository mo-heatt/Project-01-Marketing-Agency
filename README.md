# Project-01
First Project in the journey to becoming a successful Web-Developer. I have build my first Project on a landing page of a marketing Agency. I have used basics of HTML and CSS for creating this project.
With this project i got to learn how one can use flex properties to easily design a navbar. I also was able to understand basic properties like padding, margin,position,etc.
